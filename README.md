### Setting up this git repository
The _simplest_ way to access the code in this repository is to download a zip file containing all its files by clicking 
the green "Code" button and then "Download ZIP" on the webpage for this repository: https://github.com/bcdaniels/CAS-570-Fundamentals-of-CAS . 
Within the unzipped folder, you can open each notebook file using Jupyter. *Note: Some notebook files depend on other code that is within the downloaded 
folder, so you will need to leave the notebook files in the folder for them to work. You can move the entire `CAS-570-Fundamentals-of-CAS-main` 
folder elsewhere on your computer, but moving files within or out of that folder will lead to problems.*

A perhaps _better_ way to access the code is to use `git`, a widely-used tool for version control. This is not required, but it is 
something you will definitely want practice using if you are aiming for a career involving any kind of collaborative coding. 
Running `git clone https://github.com/bcdaniels/CAS-570-Fundamentals-of-CAS.git` at a command line will create a subdirectory containing 
a copy of the code as a full `git` repository, with all the version control powers that entails. There are plenty of places to get introduced 
to the basics of `git`. A good start would be to review 
[the basic git commands](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-basics-of-git-in-under-10-minutes-da548267cc91/) 
and [the popular github workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).
